Rubberband: a simple, flexible programming language

This is still an early version. If you wanna try it anyway, here's what you
need:
 - CMake (2.8 or newer)
 - Make
 - g++ and gcc (4.8 or newer*, because of many c++11 features in use)
   or
 - clang (3.3 or newer**)
 
 *  Theoretically, gcc 4.7 should work, but it failed to build when I tried, so
    the newer, the better
 ** I think clang 3.2 or 3.1 might both compile successfully, but I haven't
    tested it

Compiling and installing the rbbs executable:
 - Compiling without installing (inside the src subdir):
       cmake . && make
   The rbbs executable will be found at the rbbs subdir and then you can just
   use it, passing the .rbb script as an argument (there's one example at the
   rbbs source dir)
 - Compiling and installing:
       cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> && make install

Running the tests:
 - The runtests.sh bash script uses the following environment variables:
   CXX: The c++ compiler
   CXX_FLAGS (default: "-g -O0" when CXX is either g++ or clang++): Flags passed to the compiler 
   THREADS (default: 1): Number of threads of the compilation process
   TESTS (default: all): Tests which will be run
   RUBBERBAND_SRC(default: $PWD/../core): Directory of rubberband's core library source code
