O: The object space
Functions:
  msg: O x O |--> O
---
_: The empty object (_ is a member of O)
msg(_, o) = _, for every o in O

S: The symbol space (S is contained in O)
_ is not a member of S
s_true is a member of S
s_false is a member of S
s_true != s_false

Let s in S, o in O
            s_true   iff o is a member of S and o = s
msg(s, o) = s_false  iff o is a member of S and o != s
            _        iff o is not a member of S

R: The real numbers (number space, R is contained in O)
_ is not a member of R
S is not contained in R

Let n in R, o in O, s_gt in S, s_eq in S, s_lt in S
            s_gt  iff o is a member of R and n > o
            s_eq  iff o is a member of R and n = o
msg(n, o) = s_lt  iff o is a member of R and n < o
            _     iff o is not a member of R

L: The list space (L is a member of O)
